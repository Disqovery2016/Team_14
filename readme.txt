1.We are using the wifi(ESP 8266 NODE MCU) module inorder to make communication with our web server to do IOT.
2.Esp 8266 will provide it's open source library,to make it user to develop a wide range of applications.
3.Any one is free to use and edit the Library files,So we have editied the Source code Reference to make the model and used in 1.ino(arduino) file.
4.In order to design the web page in HTML and PHP files we have used the fallowing Sites as a Referance:

             http://www.w3schools.com/  Websites
			 
			 
			 Head First With PHP,Head First With SQL,Head First With HTML,Head First With CSS Books.and there official site is http://www.headfirstlabs.com/
			 
These referances are helping us a lot to make complete the task in a Given time.
