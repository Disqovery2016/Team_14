The Project demo is available on http://v16he2v4.esy.es/ 

The project aims to facilitate the Platform meant for interfacing the garbage buyers and sellers. The aim is to keep the streets clean, improvise the living conditions and at the same time utilise the garabage for making useful products.
The Web App uses BootStrap for designing a responsive GUI. 

Important note to set up the project:
1) Create the database and import disq.sql
2) Replace the credentials for database connections in php.
